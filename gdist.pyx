"""
This module defines a Cython wrapper for the geodesic distance C++ library.
The algorithm (implemented in C++) extends Mitchell, Mount and Papadimitriou 
(1987) and was written by Danil Kirsanov
(http://code.google.com/archive/p/geodesic/).
    
The interface definitions and wrapper functions are written in Cython syntax 
(http://cython.org/) and provide an API for some of the classes, functions and 
constants useful for calculating the geodesic distance. 

To compile, and build gdist.so using Cython::
    
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

        the shortest distance to the target vertices from the nearest source

        the mesh are considered as targets, however, in this case, specifying
        max_distance will limit the targets to those vertices within
        max_distance of a source.
    
    NOTE: This is the function to use when specifying localised stimuli and
    parameter variations. For efficiently using the whole mesh as sources, such
    as is required to represent local connectivity within the cortex, see the 
    local_gdist_matrix() function.
