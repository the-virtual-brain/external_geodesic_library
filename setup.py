The gdist module is a Cython interface to a C++ library
(http://code.google.com/p/geodesic/) for computing
geodesic distance which is the length of shortest line between two
vertices on a triangulated mesh in three dimensions, such that the line
lies on the surface.

The algorithm is due Mitchell, Mount and Papadimitriou, 1987; the
implementation is due to Danil Kirsanov and the Cython interface to Gaurav
Malhotra and Stuart Knock."""
